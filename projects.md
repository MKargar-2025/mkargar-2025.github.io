# ðŸ§  PhD Project

**Connected Speech in Ageing and TIA: A Study of Cognitiveâ€‘Linguistic Change**

My PhD research explores subtle changes in language and cognition in individuals with Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) and in Healthy Ageing.  
Using connected speech tasks in both singleâ€‘ and dualâ€‘task conditions, the study aims to identify early signs of cognitiveâ€‘linguistic impairment.  
The research combines discourse analysis with neuropsychological and selfâ€‘report assessments to better understand language decline in atâ€‘risk groups.
