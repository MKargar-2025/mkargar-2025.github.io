  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm Mahmoud Kargar, a PhD researcher in Speech and Language Sciences at Newcastle University.</p>
  <p>My research explores the relationship between language and cognition, with a particular focus on connected speech analysis in individuals with Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) and healthy ageing. I aim to combine cognitive-linguistic assessment with clinical insight to better understand subtle changes in communication.</p>
  <p>I'm passionate about research, teaching, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary collaboration. This website reflects both my academic profile and personal interests, including thoughts on music, films, and everyday reflections.</p>
  <p>Feel free to explore my <a href="/projects/">Research Projects</a> or check out the <a href="/blog/">Blog &amp; Reflections</a>.</p>
