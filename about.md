# About Me

I'm Mahmoud Kargar, a PhD researcher in Speech and Language Sciences at Newcastle University.  
My research focuses on connected speech analysis in people with Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) and healthy ageing, combining cognitive-linguistic assessment with clinical insight.

I am passionate about academic research, teaching, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary collaboration.  
This site reflects both my academic identity and my personal journey â€” including thoughts on music, film, and everyday reflections.

Feel free to explore my [Research Projects](projects.md) or check out the [Blog & Reflections](blog.md).
