# About Me

I'm Mahmoud Kargar, a PhD researcher in Speech and Language Sciences at Newcastle University.  
My research explores the relationship between language and cognition, with a particular focus on connected speech analysis in individuals with Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) and healthy ageing. I aim to combine cognitive-linguistic assessment with clinical insight to better understand subtle changes in communication.

I'm passionate about research, teaching, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary collaboration.  
This website reflects both my academic profile and personal interests, including thoughts on music, films, and everyday reflections.
